# practice-php-function
use some php functions
I had errors for: 1:preventDefault for a button(jquery), 
                  2:adressing key of an array as a string(in $_POST['blahblah'], 
                  3:passing data in post method with jquery(data:{blah:'blah'}, 
                  4:using empty instead of isset(it seems isset in many cases returns true even when with empty value for input)
